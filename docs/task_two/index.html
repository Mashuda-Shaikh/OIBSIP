      <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg</strong> was born on <strong>May 14, 1984</strong>, in White Plains, New York. From a young age, he displayed a strong interest in computers and software development. While studying at <strong>Harvard University</strong>, he launched a site called <em>"The Facebook"</em> with his roommates in 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform quickly grew beyond college campuses and evolved into one of the most powerful social networking platforms globally. Zuckerberg left Harvard to focus on Facebook full-time, leading it to success with billions of users worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021, he renamed the company to <strong>Meta</strong> to focus on building the future of the internetâ€”<em>the metaverse</em>. Alongside his business ventures, Mark supports global education, science, and equality through the <strong>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</strong>, which he co-founded with his wife, Priscilla Chan.

      Despite many challenges, he stayed focused on growth and innovation. His work has connected billions of people and opened new paths in technology and communication. His passion for building and problem-solving truly inspires me.

      He is also a philanthropist through the <strong>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</strong>, which works to promote equality and improve human potential. His commitment to using technology for social good is something I deeply respect.

      Mark is a continuous learner. He sets personal challenges like learning new languages and reading more books. He believes in working hard, staying curious, and always improving. These qualities make him a strong role model for many young minds.
